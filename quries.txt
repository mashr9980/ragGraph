Test Queries for Extended Microservices Dataset
Basic Queries

List all microservices and their technologies.
Show me all the dependencies of the AnalyticsService.
Who is responsible for maintaining the NotificationService?
What are the current open tasks?
List all team members of TeamE.

Relationship Queries

Which microservices depend on the NoSQLDatabase?
Show me all the microservices that the OrderService depends on.
Which teams are collaborating with TeamA?
List all tasks assigned to TeamF.
What are the skills of the team lead for TeamE?

Complex Queries

Find all microservices that both depend on a NoSQLDatabase and have a task with 'High' priority.
List all team members who are working on a task related to a microservice with an average response time greater than 100ms.
Show me the path of dependencies from the OrderService to the LoggingService.
Which microservices are involved in tasks that have team members with 'Python' skills assigned to them?
Find all microservices that are maintained by teams that have worked on completed projects.

Time-Based Queries

What are the upcoming task deadlines for the next 3 months?
List all tasks sorted by their deadline, along with their associated microservices and assigned teams.
Which tasks are overdue (deadline has passed) and what microservices are they linked to?
Show me all projects completed in the last 6 months and the teams that worked on them.
What is the average time given for task completion (difference between creation date and deadline)?

Performance and Optimization Queries

List all microservices sorted by their average response time.
Which microservice has the highest average response time and what tasks are currently linked to it?
Find all 'Optimization' related tasks and their associated microservices' current performance metrics.
Which team is responsible for the microservice with the lowest average response time?
List all 'High' priority tasks that are linked to microservices with an average response time greater than 100ms.

Cross-Team and Multi-Entity Queries

Detail the CrossTeamOptimization task, including all involved microservices, assigned teams, and team members' skills.
Which microservices are involved in tasks that span across more than two teams?
List all team leads and the average response time of the microservices maintained by their teams.
Find all microservices that are maintained by teams with members having both 'Machine Learning' and 'Security' skills.
What is the distribution of task priorities across different microservices and teams?

Analytical Queries

What is the average number of dependencies per microservice?
Which team is assigned the most 'High' priority tasks?
What percentage of tasks are currently 'In Progress'?
Which technology is most commonly used across all microservices?
How many tasks, on average, are assigned to each team?

Error Handling and Edge Cases

Find information about a non-existent microservice named "FakeService".
What happens if we try to find the team lead of a non-existent team?
Try to list all tasks with an invalid priority level.
Attempt to find dependencies of a microservice that has no dependencies.
What is the result when we ask for the average response time of all microservices, including those without this metric?
